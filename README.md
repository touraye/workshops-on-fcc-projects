# Workshops on FCC Projects

This is a series of workshops around [FreeCodeCamp's projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). Each workshop is a full day event for about two to three days. Here is how it will go;

- We might do one or two workshops for a certification, it depends on the complexity of the projects and the time.

- The first two days will be spent on reviewing the most important concepts  on that certification and the final day will be spent on how to go about solving the projects. All the projects under that certification must be finish and push to GitHub before the next workshop.

  

## Venue

There are several locations (MDI, GTTI and The Gambia College ) for these workshops, the location will be announce a week before the workshop.

### Rationale

The basis for these workshops are to:

1. Come together as a community and support each others growth.
2. Since Internet connectivity is a big issue in The Gambia, we will meet at a venue with a high speed Internet connection to go through some of the activities on FCC.
3. Ayaat will teach these concepts face to face to cement the concepts at a deeper level.



## How to get Started
